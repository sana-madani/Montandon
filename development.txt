Over the course of our project with the Red Cross, our journey began on October 12, 2023, where we read through reports, formulated questions for our mentor, and gained a comprehensive understanding of the basic project requirements. Initiating our thought process on potential prototypes, we delved into the existing website and GitHub repository for insights, whilst also keeping the user experience and personas at the forefront of our considerations.

As we progressed into October 26, 2023, our focus shifted to the conceptualisation phase. We crafted initial sketches, sought input from our colleague Hamish for improvements, and iteratively refined our designs based on feedback. This collaborative approach persisted through the development of prototypes, leading to our HCI presentation that encapsulated our vision for the project.

November 9, 2023, we began a deep dive into the technical aspects of our work. Discussions revolved around the languages required for implementation, consideration of our involvement in the backend, and the need to adapt to potential changes in the database structure.

As the month unfolded, on November 23, we explored essential questions related to hazard coordinates, data on hazard ranges, and affected areas, mapping out key elements crucial for the subsequent stages.

Approaching December, on the 7th, we delved into more specific inquiries, ensuring that our data did not overlap with the existing GO platform. We also engaged in thorough research, successfully implementing a feature that showcases specific areas and their specified ranges. 

With a clearer vision, December 21, 2023, marked a significant milestone as we were provided with an example of the geospatial database, paving the way for the initiation of the interactive mapping feature, alongside the creation of the first prototype for the landing page.

On January 4, 2024, we commenced work on our elevator pitch presentation, crafted a visualisation for the interactive mapping, and designed the landing page. This marked substantial progress in realising our vision for the Montandon Platform, as we continued to bridge the gap between conceptualisation and tangible implementation.
