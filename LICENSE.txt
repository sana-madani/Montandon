We would like to express our gratitude to the IFRC GO project and its contributors for their open-source initiative. Our project builds upon the foundation laid by the IFRC GO's efforts in making hazard data accessible and interactive. The commitment of the IFRC GO project to open-source solutions and community engagement has significantly influenced the development of our platform. By sharing their resources and knowledge freely, they have not only contributed to the global community's resilience but have also inspired us to develop and share our own contributions. We encourage users and developers to explore the IFRC GO project to better understand the roots of our platform and to support their ongoing work.
